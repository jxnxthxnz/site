# Interests

Surprise, surprise, I have other interests besides coding!
<ul>
  <li>I'm a huge foodie, and I write food reviews for my <a href="https://ucsdguardian.org/?s=Jonathan+zhang" target="_blank">university newspaper</a>. I also wrote for my <a href="https://basisbugle.com" target="_blank"> high school newspaper</a> and created the entire site.</li>
  <li>I love everything aviation and travelling. I track all my <a href="https://my.flightradar24.com/jxnxthnx#" target="_blank"> flights</a> as well.</li>
  <li>I'm obsessed with comedy and look up to Conan O'Brien as my comedic idol!</li>
</ul>
